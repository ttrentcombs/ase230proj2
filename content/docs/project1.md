## Overview

Project 1 is a **Concert REST API** that provides:

- User registration and login
- Venue management
- Concert management
- Ticket booking

The API is built with **PHP** and **MySQL** and was originally documented with Marp slides, which I later converted into this Hugo page for my portfolio.

## Responsibilities

- Designed the **database schema** (users, venues, concerts, bookings)
- Implemented PHP endpoints for all CRUD operations
- Added simple **token-based authentication** using Bearer tokens
- Tested endpoints using cURL and browser tools
- Deployed the API behind an **NGINX** server

## What I Learned

- How to design a REST-style backend
- How to connect PHP to MySQL and use foreign keys
- Basics of server configuration and deployment with NGINX
- How to write technical documentation and later migrate it into a static site generator (Hugo)
